## 1. Incremental Development

### Paragraph to submit:

<br>We choosed Incremental Development as our software development life cycle. Since more assignments about this project are expected to be published, some changes to this project might be required. As a result, we think that a model that is able to accommodate changes is most suitable for this project. Incremental development requires multiple versions of the project to be published frequently, so the model allows executable products to be generated earlier, and further modification can be done in later versions. In this way, modification is encouraged and the possibility of a complete failure of the product is reduced. The restriction of this model is that to rectify a task done in previous version requires modifications in all units and is time-consuming.
